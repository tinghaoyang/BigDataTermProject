Authors: Satoshi Iso, Dimitra Karabali and B. Sakita,Based on the observation that a particle motion in one dimension maps to atwo dimensional motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field constrained in the lowest Landau level we formulate a system of one dimen sional nonrelativistic fermions by using a Chern Simons field theory in 2+1dimensions Using a hydrodynamical formulation we obtain a two dimensionaldroplet picture of one dimensional fermions The dynamics involved is that ofthe boundary between a uniform density of particles and vortices We use thesharp boundary approximation In the case of well separated boundaries wederive the one dimensional collective field Hamiltonian Symmetries of thetheory are also discussed as properties of curves in two dimensions
Authors: V.Spiridonov,Within the standard quantum mechanics a q deformation of the simplest N 2supersymmetry algebra is suggested Resulting physical systems do not haveconserved charges and degeneracies in the spectra Instead superpartnerHamiltonians are q isospectral i e the spectrum of one can be obtained fromanother by the q 2 factor scaling A special class of the self similarpotentials is shown to obey the dynamical conformal symmetry algebra su q 1 1 These potentials exhibit exponential spectra and corresponding raising andlowering operators satisfy the q deformed harmonic oscillator algebra ofBiedenharn and Macfarlane
Authors: C.F.E. Holzhey and F. Wilczek,It is argued that the qualitative features of black holes regarded asquantum mechanical objects depend both on the parameters of the hole and onthe microscopic theory in which it is embedded A thermal description isinadequate for extremal holes In particular extreme holes of the chargeddilaton family can have zero entropy but non zero and even for a 1 formally infinite temperature The existence of a tendency to radiate at theextreme which threatens to overthrow any attempt to identify the entropy asavailable internal states and also to expose a naked singularity is at firstsight quite disturbing However by analyzing the perturbations around theextreme holes we show that these holes are protected by mass gaps oralternatively potential barriers which remove them from thermal contact withthe external world We suggest that the behavior of these extreme dilaton blackholes which from the point of view of traditional black hole theory seemsquite bizarre can reasonably be interpreted as the holes doing their best tobehave like normal elementary particles The a 1 holes behave qualitativelyas extended objects
Authors: Barton Zwiebach,A minimal area problem imposing different length conditions on open andclosed curves is shown to define a one parameter family of covariantopen closed quantum string field theories These interpolate from a recentlyproposed factorizable open closed theory up to an extended version of Witten sopen string field theory capable of incorporating on shell closed strings Thestring diagrams of the latter define a new decomposition of the moduli spacesof Riemann surfaces with punctures and boundaries based on quadraticdifferentials with both first order and second order poles
Authors: Noah Linden and Malcolm Perry,We show how to construct path integrals for quantum mechanical systems wherethe space of configurations is a general non compact symmetric space Associated with this path integral is a perturbation theory which respects theglobal structure of the system This perturbation expansion is evaluated for asimple example and leads to a new exactly soluble model This work is a steptowards the construction of a strong coupling perturbation theory for quantumgravity
Authors: Sheldon Katz,By considering mirror symmetry applied to conformal field theoriescorresponding to strings propagating in quintic hypersurfaces in projective4 space Candelas de la Ossa Green and Parkes calculated the number ofrational curves on the hypersurface by comparing three point functions Actually the number of curves may be infinite for special examples what isreally being calculated is a path integral The point of this talk is to givemathematical techniques and examples for computing the finite number that should correspond to an infinite family of curves which coincides withthat given by the path integral in every known instance and to suggest thatthese techniques should provide the answer to the not yet solved problem of howto calculate instanton corrections to the three point function in general
Authors: Bernd Bruegmann, Rodolfo Gambini, Jorge Pullin,We find a consistent formulation of the constraints of Quantum Gravity with acosmological constant in terms of the Ashtekar new variables in the connectionrepresentation including the existence of a state that is a solution to allthe constraints This state is related to the Chern Simons form constructedfrom the Ashtekar connection and has an associated metric in spacetime that iseverywhere nondegenerate We then transform this state to the looprepresentation and find solutions to all the constraint equations forintersecting loops These states are given by suitable generalizations of theJones knot polynomial for the case of intersecting knots These are the firstphysical states of Quantum Gravity for which an explicit form is known both inthe connection and loop representations Implications of this result are alsodiscussed
Authors: Shahar Ben-Menahem (SLAC),The D 0 matrix model is reformulated as a 2d nonlocal quantum field theory The interactions occur on the one dimensional line of hermitian matrixeigenvalues The field is conjugate to the density of matrix eigenvalues whichappears in the Jevicki Sakita collective field theory The classical solutionof the field equation is either unique or labeled by a discrete index Such asolution corresponds to the Dyson sea modified by an entropy term Themodification smoothes the sea edges and interpolates between differenteigenvalue bands for multiple well potentials Our classical eigenvalue densitycontains nonplanar effects and satisfies a local nonlinear Schr
