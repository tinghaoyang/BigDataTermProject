In these lecture notes we review the various relations between intersectiontheory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces integrable hierarchies of KdVtype matrix models and topological quantum field theories We explain inparticular why matrix integrals of the type considered by Kontsevich naturallyappear as tau functions associated to minimal models Our starting point is theextremely simple form of the string equation for the topological p 1 models where the so called Baker Akhiezer function is given by a generalized Airyfunction
