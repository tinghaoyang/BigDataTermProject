Authors: F.Bonechi, E.Celeghini, R.Giachetti, E.Sorace and M.Tarlini,The quantum deformed 1+1 Poincare algebra is shown to be the kinematicalsymmetry of the harmonic chain whose spacing is given by the deformationparameter Phonons with their symmetries as well as multiphonon processes arederived from the quantum group structure Inhomogeneous quantum groups are thusproposed as kinematical invariance of discrete systems
Authors: Robbert Dijkgraaf,In these lecture notes we review the various relations between intersectiontheory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces integrable hierarchies of KdVtype matrix models and topological quantum field theories We explain inparticular why matrix integrals of the type considered by Kontsevich naturallyappear as tau functions associated to minimal models Our starting point is theextremely simple form of the string equation for the topological p 1 models where the so called Baker Akhiezer function is given by a generalized Airyfunction
Authors: Nathan Berkovits,By defining the heterotic Green Schwarz superstring action on an N 2 0 super worldsheet rather than on an ordinary worldsheet many problems with theinteracting Green Schwarz superstring formalism can be solved In thelight cone approach superconformally transforming the light conesuper worldsheet onto an N 2 0 super Riemann surface allows the eliminationof the non trivial interaction point operators that complicate the evaluationof scattering amplitudes In the Polyakov approach the ten dimensionalheterotic Green Schwarz covariant action defined on an N 2 0 super worldsheetcan be gauge fixed to a free field action with non anomalous N 2 0 superconformal invariance and integrating the exponential of the covariantaction over all punctured N 2 0 super Riemann surfaces produces scatteringamplitudes that closely resemble amplitudes obtained using the unitarylight cone approach

Authors: Eva Silverstein,The simplest toroidally compactified string theories exhibit a dualitybetween large and small radii compactification on a circle for example isinvariant under R goes to 1 R Compactification on more general Lorentzianlattices i e toroidal compactification in the presence of background metric antisymmetric tensor and gauge fields yields theories for which large smallinvariance is not so simple Here an equivalence is demonstrated between largeand small geometries for all toroidal compactifications By repeatedlytransforming the momentum mode corresponding to the smallest winding length toanother mode on the lattice it is possible to increase the volume to exceed afinite lower bound
Authors: A.Marshakov, A.Mironov and A.Morozov,We demonstrate the equivalence of Virasoro constraints imposed on continuumlimit of partition function of Hermitean 1 matrix model and the Ward identitiesof Kontsevich s model Since the first model describes ordinary d 2 quantumgravity while the second one is supposed to coincide with Witten s topologicalgravity the result provides a strong implication that the two models areindeed the same
