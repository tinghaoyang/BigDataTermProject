Authors: Satoshi Iso, Dimitra Karabali and B. Sakita,Based on the observation that a particle motion in one dimension maps to atwo dimensional motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field constrained in the lowest Landau level we formulate a system of one dimen sional nonrelativistic fermions by using a Chern Simons field theory in 2+1dimensions Using a hydrodynamical formulation we obtain a two dimensionaldroplet picture of one dimensional fermions The dynamics involved is that ofthe boundary between a uniform density of particles and vortices We use thesharp boundary approximation In the case of well separated boundaries wederive the one dimensional collective field Hamiltonian Symmetries of thetheory are also discussed as properties of curves in two dimensions

Authors: C.F.E. Holzhey and F. Wilczek,It is argued that the qualitative features of black holes regarded asquantum mechanical objects depend both on the parameters of the hole and onthe microscopic theory in which it is embedded A thermal description isinadequate for extremal holes In particular extreme holes of the chargeddilaton family can have zero entropy but non zero and even for a 1 formally infinite temperature The existence of a tendency to radiate at theextreme which threatens to overthrow any attempt to identify the entropy asavailable internal states and also to expose a naked singularity is at firstsight quite disturbing However by analyzing the perturbations around theextreme holes we show that these holes are protected by mass gaps oralternatively potential barriers which remove them from thermal contact withthe external world We suggest that the behavior of these extreme dilaton blackholes which from the point of view of traditional black hole theory seemsquite bizarre can reasonably be interpreted as the holes doing their best tobehave like normal elementary particles The a 1 holes behave qualitativelyas extended objects

Authors: Abhay Ashtekar and C.J. Isham,Holonomy algebras arise naturally in the classical description of Yang Millsfields and gravity and it has been suggested at a heuristic level that theymay also play an important role in a non perturbative treatment of the quantumtheory The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical basis for thisproposal The quantum holonomy algebra is constructed and in the case of realconnections given the structure of a certain C star algebra A properrepresentation theory is then provided using the Gel fand spectral theory Acorollory of these general results is a precise formulation of the looptransform proposed by Rovelli and Smolin Several explicit representations ofthe holonomy algebra are constructed The general theory developed here impliesthat the domain space of quantum states can always be taken to be the space ofmaximal ideals of the C star algebra The structure of this space isinvestigated and it is shown how observables labelled by strips arisenaturally
Authors: Abhay Ashtekar, Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin,The recently proposed loop representation used previously to find exactsolutions to the quantum constraints of general relativity is here used toquantize linearized general relativity The Fock space of graviton states andits associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionalsof loops The reality conditions are realized by an inner product that ischiral asymmetric resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for theHamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handedgravitons This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of thelinearized field into self dual and anti self dual parts rather than intopositive and negative frequency parts as the former but not the latter ismeaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful inconnecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory The formalismdepends on an arbitrary averaging function that controls certaindivergences but does not appear in the final physical quantities Inspite ofthese somewhat unusual features the loop quntization presented here iscompletely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity

Authors: Kiyoshi Kamimura, Sinobu Makita and Takeshi Fukuyama,The action of general relativity proposed by Capovilla Jacobson and Dell iswritten in terms of SO 3 gauge fields and gives Ashtekar s constraints forEinstein gravity However it does not depend on the space time metric nor itssignature explicitly We discuss how the space time metric is introduced fromalgebraic relations of the constraints and the Hamiltonian by focusing ourattention on the signature factor The system describes both Euclidian andLorentzian metrics depending on reality assignments of the gauge connections That is Euclidian metrics arise from the real gauge fields On the other hand self duality of the gauge fields which is well known in the Ashtekar sformalism is also derived in this theory from consistency condition ofLorentzian metric We also show that the metric so determined is equivalent tothat given by Urbantke which is usually accepted as a definition of the metricfor this system

Authors: S.B. Giddings,This paper revisits the conundrum faced when one attempts to understand thedynamics of black hole formation and evaporation without abandoning unitaryevolution Previous efforts to resolve this puzzle assume that informationescapes in corrections to the Hawking process that an arbitrarily large amountof information is transmitted by a planckian energy or contained in aPlanck sized remnant or that the information is lost to another universe Eachof these possibilities has serious difficulties This paper considers anotheralternative remnants that carry large amounts of information and whose sizeand mass depend on their information content The existence of such objects issuggested by attempts to incorporate a Planck scale cutoff into physics Theywould greatly alter the late stages of the evaporation process The maindrawback of this scenario is apparent acausal behavior behind the horizon

Authors: Marc Henneaux, Claudio Teitelboim, J. David Vergara,Previous analyses on the gauge invariance of the action for a generallycovariant system are generalized It is shown that if the action principle isproperly improved there is as much gauge freedom at the endpoints for anarbitrary gauge system as there is for a system with internal gaugesymmetries The key point is to correctly identify the boundary conditions forthe allowed histories and to include the appropriate end point contribution inthe action The path integral is then discussed It is proved that by employingthe improved action one can use time independent canonical gauges even in thecase of generally covariant theories From the point of view of the action andthe path integral there is thus no conceptual difference between generalcovariance and ordinary gauge invariance The discussion is illustrated inthe case of the point particle for which various canonical gauges areconsidered

Authors: T. Brzezinski and S. Majid,We study the quantum group gauge theory developed elsewhere in the limit whenthe base space spacetime is a classical space rather than a general quantumspace We show that this limit of the theory for gauge quantum group U q g is isomorphic to usual gauge theory with Lie algebra g Thus a new kind ofgauge theory is not obtained in this way although we do find some differencesin the coupling to matter Our analysis also illuminates certaininconsistencies in previous work on this topic where a different conclusion hadbeen reached In particular we show that the use of the quantum trace indefining a Yang Mills action in this setting is not appropriate
